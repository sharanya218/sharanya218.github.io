### Dataset
The dataset that interested me the most is [Mental Health in Tech Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey)

**Dataset Source - [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/)**

Despite several resources being available and so much talk going around town about how to apporach help regarding disorders related to mental health, there still exists taboo around the topic and people tend to ignore it. The mentality of taking care of one's mental health has a long way to come to be at par with physical health. Therefore by collecting a survey on how people think about mental health, the way to approach people it can be worked upon by professionals.

This dataset includes attributes such as Timestamp, country, age, gender, family_history, tech_company, care_options, anonymity, leave, mentalhealthinterview, physicalhealthinterview, mentalvsphysical, etc.

This dataset is a survey taken to observe people's general attitude towards mental health by time and location and the frequency of mental mental health disorders in tech workplaces.
Somethings worth exploring via this dataset would be:

1. What are some the clearest indicators of mental health

2. In which country, what age and which genderare mental disorders affecting people the most

3. What is the general attitude regarding mental health in the tech workplace among people

### Data Science Book

The book that inetersted me the most was [The Promise and Peril of Big Data](https://www.aspeninstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/files/content/docs/pubs/The_Promise_and_Peril_of_Big_Data.pdf)

**Authors of the book - David Bollier, Rapporteur**

**Institute book is published under - Communications and Society Program
Charles M. Firestone
Executive Director
Washington, DC**

The title caught my attention because we tend to only think of what good big data has in store for us but if mishandle it, we must also face the consequences. The author explains what data comes bearing for us and how to find correlations among the humongous data present at our hands. It also talks about the healthcare sector in particular and how data analytics can be applied there, which would be helpful for me as I wish to venture into healthcare analytics.
